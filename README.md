# PriceIsRight

This is project that involves HTML and CSS for designing the platform and putting things together while PHP is used to submitting form data and processing the request over the server. 

The main screen should take you to a price is right homepage where you enter a number.
From there if you enter the right number, you have the option to go to the next level.
If you enter the wrong number, a message is displayed and you have the option to go back and start the game again!
